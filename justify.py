"""
Write a program in Python, that can accept a paragraph string and and page
width and return an array of left AND right justified strings.  NOTE: No words
should be broken, the beginning and end of the line should be characters).

You should provide instructions on how to execute your program and provide a
sample output.

Example:

Sample input:

Paragraph = "This is a sample text but a complicated problem to be solved, so
we are adding more text to see that it actually works."

Page Width = 20


Output should look like this:

Array [1] = "This  is  a   sample"
Array [2] = "text      but      a"
Array [3] = "complicated  problem"
Array [4] = "to be solved, so  we"
Array [5] = "are adding more text"
Array [6] = "to   see   that   it"
Array [7] = "actually      works.‚Äù
